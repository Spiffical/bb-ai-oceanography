# machine learning applications in ocean sciences

#### Highlights<br/>
- Different methods have been so far developed to derive oceanographic parameters from RS datasets. These methods can be generally divided into three groups of statistical, physical, and Machine Learning (ML) models. Statistical algorithms are mainly based on the correlation relationships between in situ measurements of oceanographic parameters and the information collected by RS systems. These models are usually easy to develop and provide fairly reasonable accuracies. However, they require in situ data, which are sometimes not available over remote ocean areas. These models also need to be optimized for different study areas. Physical models (e.g., Radiative Transfer (RT)) are based on the physical laws of the RS systems. Although these models usually provide better results than statistical models, they require many inputs that are usually not available. Recently, ML algorithms, either traditional (e.g., Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) or more advanced models (e.g., Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)), have been frequently utilized for various oceanographic applications. Generally, like many other applications of RS, Deep Learning (DL) methods provide higher accuracies compared to statistical, physical, and traditional ML algorithms However, it should be noted that DL methods require a very large number of training data and are computationally expensive . Consequently, it is sometimes more reasonable to utilize other, less-costly ML algorithms . [Amani et al](https://doi.org/10.3390/w14213400)<br/>
- ESTIMATING OCEAN SUBSURFACE SALINITY FROM REMOTE SENSING DATA BY MACHINE LEARNING [Su et al](https://doi.org/10.1109/igarss.2019.8898899)<br/>
- Previous efforts to improve estuarine NPP estimation by remote sensing mainly focused on the tuning of standard primary production algorithms based on a large quantity of local in situ data(Harding et al., 2002;Son et al., 2014). Advanced statistical methods such as machine learning emerge as promising alternatives, and they have been successfully applied to estimate marine primary production from satellite ocean color data. For example,Tang et al. showed better performance of support vector machine than the VGPM for determining primary production in oceanic waters. Neural networks developed byScardi andScardi have been used to estimate marine phytoplankton production on a global scale(Mattei et al., 2021;Mattei et al., 2018).Huang et al. also used random forest for global estimates of marine primary production, excluding coastal areas with bathymetry shallower than 200 m. A recent effort has applied enhanced random forest integrated with a semi-analytical model to estimate primary production in oceanic and inland waters(Li et al., 2022). Despite these demonstrated progress, there is limited research on how these approaches may be applicable for turbid estuarine waters. In this paper, we will explore the use of machine learning algorithms to estimate primary production in estuaries from satellite image data and examine the primary production spatial and long-term trend and their contributing environmental factors. [Xu et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.102821)<br/>
- For decades, advanced signal processing techniques have been used for signal classification. More recently, machine and deep learning models have been applied to underwater sound signals to make use of their pattern recognition in order to identify the sound signal sources. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence which includes systems that can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human interference. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning which uses neural networks with more than two layers. [Earnhardt et al](https://doi.org/10.1121/2.0001475)<br/>
-  Sea surface nitrate (SSN) plays an important role in assessing phytoplankton growth and new production in the ocean. Field sampling of SSN data is important, but limited by data quantity both spatially and temporally. Satellite remote sensing can contribute through providing spatial and temporal data to such assessments. During the past 30 years many studies have been published focusing on SSN retrievals from satellites to a greater or less extent. In this study, we reviewed the progresses of SSN estimation from satellites in both open ocean and coastal waters. Because of the lack of electromagnetic properties of SSN, satellite retrievals of SSN were most realized by developing relationships between SSN and related environmental variables (e.g., sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a concentration, sea surface salinity), using traditional empirical regressions and novel machine learning techniques. We synthesized most of the peer-reviewed studies for both open and coastal oceans, in terms of study areas, model inputs, regression formulas, and model uncertainties. In general, regional SSN algorithms were most developed in coastal oceans with upwelling or river discharges. The published SSN algorithms had varying uncertainties with a wide range of 0.83-6.87 μmol/L, and the uncertainties were significantly reduced in recent studies, with more field measurements available and better understanding of the physical and biogeochemical processes in driving nitrate dynamics.

#### Summary<br/>
model
Machine learning (ML) is rapidly gaining traction in ocean sciences, offering powerful tools to analyze the vast and complex datasets generated by oceanographic studies. ML algorithms learn from existing data to make predictions about new, unseen data, making them ideal for tackling the intricacies of oceanic systems. 

The ability of ML to handle big data and identify patterns is particularly valuable in understanding climate change and its impacts on oceans.  "Machine learning is particularly well-suited for analyzing the complex dynamics of ocean eddies, which play a critical role in transporting heat, nutrients, and other important substances throughout the oceans." ([Ashkezari et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1002/2016gl071269)) For instance, ML can be used to estimate ocean surface currents, which are crucial for understanding the global circulation patterns and their role in climate regulation. ([Phillips et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2020.00365)) 

ML is also proving effective in addressing specific oceanographic challenges, such as predicting harmful algal blooms, hypoxia, and sea-level rise. These applications highlight the potential of ML to contribute to the conservation and sustainable management of marine ecosystems.  "Machine learning techniques show a lot of promise for improving the quality and scope of marine research by detecting implicit patterns and hidden trends, especially in big datasets that are difficult to analyze with traditional methods." ([Sunkara et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2023.1075822))

However, the field of ML in ocean sciences is still relatively young, and there are challenges to overcome. One key challenge is the need for more comprehensive and standardized datasets to train and evaluate ML models. "While traditional analysis methods always involve substantial manual and expert judgements, machine learning methods can process entire datasets automatically, and possibly extract new information from existing datasets for new insights." ([Tse et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11707-018-0704-1)) Another challenge is the interpretability of ML models, as the complex algorithms can sometimes make it difficult to understand how they arrive at their predictions. 

Despite these challenges, the potential of ML to revolutionize ocean sciences is immense. As ML algorithms continue to improve and datasets grow, we can expect to see even more groundbreaking applications in the years to come. "The latest technological advancements in the development and production of sensors have led to their increased usage in marine science, thus expanding data volume and rates within the field." ([Sunkara et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2023.1075822))


Machine learning is a promising method for locating ocean sources because of its ability to learn features from data, without requiring sound propagation modeling. It can be used for unknown environments. ([Niu et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1121/1.5000165))


The objective of the study is to apply unsupervised machine learning methods onto the SCS ocean drilling datasets which are widely regarded as some of the most comprehensive in the world.  ([Tse et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11707-018-0704-1))


The authors recently developed and demonstrated a machine-learning surrogate model for a physics-based ocean-wave model. The model generated a nonlinear mapping of inputs (i. e. wave height, period, and direction boundary conditions, spatially variable ocean currents, and wind speeds) to computed outputs (spatially variable significant wave height, H s , and characteristic wave period, T ). The machine-learning model yielded enormous speedup (>five-thousand-fold) in computational time while maintaining accuracy that was well within the confidence bounds of the physics-based model. ([O’Donncha et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2019.103206))



The use of ML in ocean sciences is expanding rapidly, with applications ranging from predicting ocean sources to estimating chlorophyll concentrations in global oceans. This interdisciplinary field holds great promise for advancing our understanding of the oceans and addressing the pressing challenges facing marine ecosystems.

# challenges or limitations in applying machine learning to ocean sciences

#### Highlights<br/>
- Different methods have been so far developed to derive oceanographic parameters from RS datasets. These methods can be generally divided into three groups of statistical, physical, and Machine Learning (ML) models. Statistical algorithms are mainly based on the correlation relationships between in situ measurements of oceanographic parameters and the information collected by RS systems. These models are usually easy to develop and provide fairly reasonable accuracies. However, they require in situ data, which are sometimes not available over remote ocean areas. These models also need to be optimized for different study areas. Physical models (e.g., Radiative Transfer (RT)) are based on the physical laws of the RS systems. Although these models usually provide better results than statistical models, they require many inputs that are usually not available. Recently, ML algorithms, either traditional (e.g., Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) or more advanced models (e.g., Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)), have been frequently utilized for various oceanographic applications. Generally, like many other applications of RS, Deep Learning (DL) methods provide higher accuracies compared to statistical, physical, and traditional ML algorithms However, it should be noted that DL methods require a very large number of training data and are computationally expensive . Consequently, it is sometimes more reasonable to utilize other, less-costly ML algorithms . [Amani et al](https://doi.org/10.3390/w14213400)<br/>
- In this study we aim to tackle a simpler problem than those cited above: training a ML model to "learn" the empirical relationships between the different observable quantities (sea surface height, wind stress, etc.) and surface currents(u, v). The hypothesis to be tested is the following: Can we use machine learning to provide surface current estimates more accurately than geostrophy + Ekman balance? The motivation for doing this exercise is 2-fold: While statistical models can often be difficult to explain due to lack of simple intuitive physical interpretations, several recent publications(Ling et al., 2016;Gentine et al., 2018;Bolton and Zanna, 2019;Zanna and Bolton, 2020)have demonstrated that data-driven approaches, used concurrently with physicsbased models can offer various computational advantages over traditional methods, while still respecting physical principles. For our problem, which is much simpler in terms of its scope, we aim to mitigate the so called "black-box" ness of statistical models in general with physically motivated choices about inputs and training strategies, to ensure results that are physically meaningful. In this study, we mainly explore two types of regression models (multiple linear regression and artificial neural networks) as potential alternative approaches for predicting surface currents, using data from a primitive equation global general circulation model, and discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses. We see this work as a stepping stone to more complex applications of ML to ocean remote sensing of ocean surface currents. [Sinha et al](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.672477)<br/>
- Previous efforts to improve estuarine NPP estimation by remote sensing mainly focused on the tuning of standard primary production algorithms based on a large quantity of local in situ data(Harding et al., 2002;Son et al., 2014). Advanced statistical methods such as machine learning emerge as promising alternatives, and they have been successfully applied to estimate marine primary production from satellite ocean color data. For example,Tang et al. showed better performance of support vector machine than the VGPM for determining primary production in oceanic waters. Neural networks developed byScardi andScardi have been used to estimate marine phytoplankton production on a global scale(Mattei et al., 2021;Mattei et al., 2018).Huang et al. also used random forest for global estimates of marine primary production, excluding coastal areas with bathymetry shallower than 200 m. A recent effort has applied enhanced random forest integrated with a semi-analytical model to estimate primary production in oceanic and inland waters(Li et al., 2022). Despite these demonstrated progress, there is limited research on how these approaches may be applicable for turbid estuarine waters. In this paper, we will explore the use of machine learning algorithms to estimate primary production in estuaries from satellite image data and examine the primary production spatial and long-term trend and their contributing environmental factors. [Xu et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.102821)<br/>
- ESTIMATING OCEAN SUBSURFACE SALINITY FROM REMOTE SENSING DATA BY MACHINE LEARNING [Su et al](https://doi.org/10.1109/igarss.2019.8898899)<br/>
-  Sea surface nitrate (SSN) plays an important role in assessing phytoplankton growth and new production in the ocean. Field sampling of SSN data is important, but limited by data quantity both spatially and temporally. Satellite remote sensing can contribute through providing spatial and temporal data to such assessments. During the past 30 years many studies have been published focusing on SSN retrievals from satellites to a greater or less extent. In this study, we reviewed the progresses of SSN estimation from satellites in both open ocean and coastal waters. Because of the lack of electromagnetic properties of SSN, satellite retrievals of SSN were most realized by developing relationships between SSN and related environmental variables (e.g., sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a concentration, sea surface salinity), using traditional empirical regressions and novel machine learning techniques. We synthesized most of the peer-reviewed studies for both open and coastal oceans, in terms of study areas, model inputs, regression formulas, and model uncertainties. In general, regional SSN algorithms were most developed in coastal oceans with upwelling or river discharges. The published SSN algorithms had varying uncertainties with a wide range of 0.83-6.87 μmol/L, and the uncertainties were significantly reduced in recent studies, with more field measurements available and better understanding of the physical and biogeochemical processes in driving nitrate dynamics.

#### Summary<br/>
model
Machine learning (ML) holds immense potential for revolutionizing ocean sciences, offering powerful tools to address complex challenges ranging from climate change to ecological monitoring.  "Machine learning which itself is a subfield of artificial intelligence, is broadly used in various fields, such as epidemiology, physics, ecology, data science, agriculture, and language processing, but is newly adapted by marine science." ([Sunkara et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2023.1075822)) Despite its potential, the application of ML in ocean sciences faces several limitations. 

One key challenge is the inherent complexity of ocean systems. "One reason why a simplified theoretical framework has prevailed when investigating the Southern Ocean circulation is the overwhelming complexity of the circulation patterns in the region." ([Sonnewald et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-00793-7))  The dynamic and interconnected nature of ocean processes makes it difficult to develop accurate and robust ML models.  

Another challenge is the availability and quality of oceanographic data. "While the increasing number of sensors and autonomous platforms is generating vast amounts of data, most machine learning techniques, such as Bayesian Networks and Support Vector Machines, although powerful, are not the most adequate approach for open water oceanographic data due to the intrinsic characteristics of such dataset." ([Castelão et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2021.104803))   The sparsity and variability of ocean observations can hinder the training and performance of ML algorithms.

Furthermore, the "black box" nature of some ML models can pose challenges for interpretability and trust. Researchers need to understand how these models arrive at their predictions to ensure their reliability and applicability in real-world scenarios. "([Sonnewald et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-00793-7)) "Here, the novel machine learning framework from ref.6is used to forge new knowledge, specifically also avoiding a 'black box' approach."


Addressing these challenges requires a multi-faceted approach. Developing new ML algorithms tailored to the specific characteristics of ocean data is crucial. "Machine learning techniques provide fascinating approaches to automatically classify data by employing reinforced learning, which is based in the principle of training the classification system with some known answers." ([Sunkara et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2023.1075822))  Collaborations between data scientists, oceanographers, and engineers are essential to bridge the gap between theoretical models and practical applications. "Our outlook is that reproducible scientific models, efficient control equations, increasing computational power, novel communication capabilities, thriving machine learning, and decision-making ability of humans will continue to be integrated to form intelligent autonomous ocean predicting and observing systems." ([Lermusiaux et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1357/002224017823524035))

Ultimately, the successful integration of ML in ocean sciences will depend on overcoming these challenges and fostering a collaborative environment that harnesses the power of this transformative technology to unlock the mysteries of the oceans.

# emerging trends or future directions in machine learning for ocean sciences

#### Highlights<br/>
- In this study we aim to tackle a simpler problem than those cited above: training a ML model to "learn" the empirical relationships between the different observable quantities (sea surface height, wind stress, etc.) and surface currents(u, v). The hypothesis to be tested is the following: Can we use machine learning to provide surface current estimates more accurately than geostrophy + Ekman balance? The motivation for doing this exercise is 2-fold: While statistical models can often be difficult to explain due to lack of simple intuitive physical interpretations, several recent publications(Ling et al., 2016;Gentine et al., 2018;Bolton and Zanna, 2019;Zanna and Bolton, 2020)have demonstrated that data-driven approaches, used concurrently with physicsbased models can offer various computational advantages over traditional methods, while still respecting physical principles. For our problem, which is much simpler in terms of its scope, we aim to mitigate the so called "black-box" ness of statistical models in general with physically motivated choices about inputs and training strategies, to ensure results that are physically meaningful. In this study, we mainly explore two types of regression models (multiple linear regression and artificial neural networks) as potential alternative approaches for predicting surface currents, using data from a primitive equation global general circulation model, and discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses. We see this work as a stepping stone to more complex applications of ML to ocean remote sensing of ocean surface currents. [Sinha et al](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.672477)<br/>
- Different methods have been so far developed to derive oceanographic parameters from RS datasets. These methods can be generally divided into three groups of statistical, physical, and Machine Learning (ML) models. Statistical algorithms are mainly based on the correlation relationships between in situ measurements of oceanographic parameters and the information collected by RS systems. These models are usually easy to develop and provide fairly reasonable accuracies. However, they require in situ data, which are sometimes not available over remote ocean areas. These models also need to be optimized for different study areas. Physical models (e.g., Radiative Transfer (RT)) are based on the physical laws of the RS systems. Although these models usually provide better results than statistical models, they require many inputs that are usually not available. Recently, ML algorithms, either traditional (e.g., Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) or more advanced models (e.g., Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)), have been frequently utilized for various oceanographic applications. Generally, like many other applications of RS, Deep Learning (DL) methods provide higher accuracies compared to statistical, physical, and traditional ML algorithms However, it should be noted that DL methods require a very large number of training data and are computationally expensive . Consequently, it is sometimes more reasonable to utilize other, less-costly ML algorithms . [Amani et al](https://doi.org/10.3390/w14213400)<br/>
- Previous efforts to improve estuarine NPP estimation by remote sensing mainly focused on the tuning of standard primary production algorithms based on a large quantity of local in situ data(Harding et al., 2002;Son et al., 2014). Advanced statistical methods such as machine learning emerge as promising alternatives, and they have been successfully applied to estimate marine primary production from satellite ocean color data. For example,Tang et al. showed better performance of support vector machine than the VGPM for determining primary production in oceanic waters. Neural networks developed byScardi andScardi have been used to estimate marine phytoplankton production on a global scale(Mattei et al., 2021;Mattei et al., 2018).Huang et al. also used random forest for global estimates of marine primary production, excluding coastal areas with bathymetry shallower than 200 m. A recent effort has applied enhanced random forest integrated with a semi-analytical model to estimate primary production in oceanic and inland waters(Li et al., 2022). Despite these demonstrated progress, there is limited research on how these approaches may be applicable for turbid estuarine waters. In this paper, we will explore the use of machine learning algorithms to estimate primary production in estuaries from satellite image data and examine the primary production spatial and long-term trend and their contributing environmental factors. [Xu et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.102821)<br/>
- For decades, advanced signal processing techniques have been used for signal classification. More recently, machine and deep learning models have been applied to underwater sound signals to make use of their pattern recognition in order to identify the sound signal sources. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence which includes systems that can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human interference. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning which uses neural networks with more than two layers. [Earnhardt et al](https://doi.org/10.1121/2.0001475)<br/>
-  Sea surface nitrate (SSN) plays an important role in assessing phytoplankton growth and new production in the ocean. Field sampling of SSN data is important, but limited by data quantity both spatially and temporally. Satellite remote sensing can contribute through providing spatial and temporal data to such assessments. During the past 30 years many studies have been published focusing on SSN retrievals from satellites to a greater or less extent. In this study, we reviewed the progresses of SSN estimation from satellites in both open ocean and coastal waters. Because of the lack of electromagnetic properties of SSN, satellite retrievals of SSN were most realized by developing relationships between SSN and related environmental variables (e.g., sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a concentration, sea surface salinity), using traditional empirical regressions and novel machine learning techniques. We synthesized most of the peer-reviewed studies for both open and coastal oceans, in terms of study areas, model inputs, regression formulas, and model uncertainties. In general, regional SSN algorithms were most developed in coastal oceans with upwelling or river discharges. The published SSN algorithms had varying uncertainties with a wide range of 0.83-6.87 μmol/L, and the uncertainties were significantly reduced in recent studies, with more field measurements available and better understanding of the physical and biogeochemical processes in driving nitrate dynamics.  [Chen et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165690)<br/>

#### Summary<br/>
model
Machine learning (ML) is rapidly becoming a valuable tool in ocean sciences, offering solutions to complex problems that traditional methods struggle with. ML's ability to handle vast datasets, identify patterns, and make predictions is particularly suited for the oceanographic realm, where data is increasingly abundant and complex.  

"Machine learning uses dynamic models to make data-driven choices, and ML approaches may be used to high-dimensional, complicated, non-linear, and big-data problems." ([Sunkara et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2023.1075822))  It is proving effective in addressing issues like ocean acidification, sea-level rise, and the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems.  

The Southern Ocean, known for its intricate circulation patterns, is a prime example of where ML is making a significant impact. "Recently, machine learning methods are being used to fuel progress within prediction, numerical modelling and beyond, speeding up and refining existing tasks (see review in refs.18,19)." ([Sonnewald et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-00793-7))  

ML's strength lies in its ability to classify complex features in oceanic systems. "Machine learning is a tool that can be leveraged to classify dynamic and complex features in oceanic systems(Jones et al., 2014;Gangopadhyay et al., 2015)." ([Phillips et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2020.00365)) This is particularly valuable for tasks like identifying ocean currents, predicting weather patterns, and understanding the distribution of marine species.

While ML shows immense promise, researchers acknowledge the need for further development and application. "The move from multi-spectral to hyperspectral remote sensing has resulted in the availability of a larger amount of information and more degrees of freedom for improving quantification of PIC. This increase in information can make it challenging for a human to find patterns and analyze the data, but opens the door to machine learning approaches." ([Balch et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2023.104363)) 

"In the future, with the explosive growth of marine big data, making efficient use of oceanic big data is still an important research direction. We will continue to explore faster, more accurate and more complex prediction models for ocean hydrological data with a combination of in-depth learning and integrated learning." ([Yang et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.3390/s19071562)) As technology advances and datasets grow, ML will undoubtedly play an increasingly crucial role in unraveling the mysteries of the ocean and ensuring its sustainable future.
